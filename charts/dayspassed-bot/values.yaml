# CronJob schedule (runs daily at midnight)
# Format: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week
# Example: "0 0 * * *" means at 00:00 every day
schedule: "0 0 * * *"

# Concurrency policy for the CronJob
# Allow: Allows concurrent runs
# Forbid: Forbids concurrent runs, skipping new ones if old one is still running
# Replace: Cancels the currently running job and replaces it with a new one
concurrencyPolicy: Forbid

# Restart policy for pods created by the CronJob
# Can be Never or OnFailure
restartPolicy: OnFailure

# Environment variables for the application
# It's highly recommended to use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data like MK_TOKEN
env:
  specificDate: "2002-02-22" # Default specific date, format YYYY-MM-DD
  # MK_TOKEN will be sourced from a secret (either existingSecret or via 1Password)
  misskeyHost: "example.tld" # Hostname of your Misskey instance
  tz: "Asia/Tokyo" # Timezone for the application and container
  customText: "Hello, world!" # Custom text to be sent with the message

# Configuration for 1Password integration
onepassword:
  enabled: false
  # Path to the item in 1Password, e.g., "vaults/your-vault/items/your-item-title"
  # or "vaults/your-vault/items/your-item-uuid"
  itemPath: "vaults/Kubernetes/items/daypassed-bot"
  # Optional: Override the name of the OnePasswordItem Kubernetes resource.
  # If not set, a name will be generated (e.g., {{ .Release.Name }}-daypassed-bot-1password).
  # This name is also used for the Kubernetes Secret created by the 1Password operator.
  itemResourceNameOverride: ""
  # The name of the field in your 1Password item that contains the token.
  # The 1Password operator will create a Kubernetes Secret with this key.
  tokenFieldInItem: "MK_TOKEN" # Ensure this field exists in your 1Password item

# If not using 1Password integration, you can specify an existing Kubernetes secret for the token:
existingSecret: "" # Name of an existing secret to use for MK_TOKEN, e.g., "misskey-token-secret"
secretTokenKey: "MK_TOKEN" # The key within the existingSecret that holds the token

resources: {}
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
  # requests:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
